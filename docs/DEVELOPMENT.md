# Development

## Baseline

`0.8.6-rc1` is the current release-candidate baseline. The 0.8.6 line adds startup-loaded SunaQ research profiles, per-user entitlement and request-local profile/runtime routing while retaining the rc5.1 live-ACL and deployment security boundaries.

## Repository layout

```text

config.yaml           middleware reference configuration
web.yaml              Web Research reference configuration
provider.env.example  provider/reference environment without secrets
versions.lock.yaml    immutable container/model compatibility pins
```

Runtime-local files are deliberately not tracked. A fresh installer creates or preserves the local `provider.env`, `runtime.env`, `runtime/` database/key material and TLS state.


## Retrieval contract

The normal provider path uses one small `SearchSpec` per retrieval round. The
Query Rewriter may write a human-style Nextcloud full-text expression in
`elastic_query`; it must never emit raw Elasticsearch JSON DSL. `semantic_query`
is reserved for the vector arm. Neo4j seed/alias context is supplied before the
rewrite, while `entities`, `concepts`, `constraints` and
`verification_requirements` remain analytical side-products. Additional
retrieval rounds may revise the SearchSpec but must re-use the same pipeline.

## Tests

Create a virtual environment and install the runtime requirements, then run:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Some graph/vector tests require the optional runtime client libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. The deployment regression tests also inspect Docker/installer/config files directly and therefore catch accidental changes to the supported topology.

GitHub Actions runs the complete pytest suite on Python 3.13 plus Python compile and shipped-shell syntax checks. The 0.8.6-rc1 branch is additionally validated on a fresh Super-Light VM against a real Nextcloud/Elasticsearch estate before public release.

## Release rule

Keep functional changes separate from repository/documentation cleanup where practical. Before a release candidate is tagged:

1. run the full pytest suite in a clean environment;
2. run the installer on a blank VM using the intended component flags;
3. execute the acceptance matrix for the profile being released (for Super-Light: API/provider, AKI/Login Flow, two-user live ACL, shared alias/Graph-Lite behavior where enabled, Web/archive behavior, Elasticsearch degradation and container restart);
4. regenerate `MANIFEST.sha256` for distributable tarballs;
5. scan the final tree for runtime databases, API keys, passwords, private keys and local environment files;
6. perform a security-invariant review against `THREAT-MODEL.md`: protected documents never reach verifier/answer evidence, shared alias knowledge does not expose protected source provenance, Finding evidence is ACL-safe for any user-facing view, and diagnostic ACL-off state is visible.
