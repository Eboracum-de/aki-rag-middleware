# Neo4j application schema

This is the canonical internal reference for the Neo4j schema supported by AKI RAG Middleware 0.8.5-rc5. It describes the application contract derived from all Cypher access in the private development repository. It is not a `SHOW SCHEMA` dump: Neo4j exposes constraints and indexes there, but not the optional property contract, secondary labels, provenance rules or compatibility fields.

## Contract rules

- A **required key** is an identifier used in `MATCH`/`MERGE` and protected by a uniqueness constraint where the label has an independent lifecycle.
- All other properties are **optional** unless a write path explicitly needs them for the operation being performed. Historic nodes and relationships may legitimately omit optional fields.
- Optional properties must be read as `properties(value)['field']` (usually with `coalesce`) so an empty or partial database does not emit `UnknownPropertyKeyWarning`.
- AKI creates constraints and indexes with `IF NOT EXISTS`. Repeating initialization is supported.
- Secondary labels such as `Person`, `Organization`, `OrganizationalUnit`, `Claim` and `AKIResearchFinding` refine a primary object; they are not separate identity stores.
- No synthetic nodes or dummy properties are created to register property tokens.

## Node labels and properties

“W” means AKI writes the field. “R” means AKI reads it. Unless marked required, listed fields are optional and may be absent on legacy data.

| `RAGSchemaMarker` | Legacy only | Older releases created marker nodes with dummy properties to register tokens. 0.8.5-rc4.1 no longer creates or reads them. Existing markers are inert and may remain until an explicit housekeeping migration is justified. | Legacy |

### Document provenance fields

The document provenance contract includes `source_origin`, `source_url`, `path`, `title`, `document_date`, `source_date`, `source_date_precision`, `source_date_confidence`, `source_date_basis` and `source_date_evidence`. Retrieval/query provenance adds `last_query_id`, `last_user_query`, `last_retrieval_query` and evidence timestamps/counters.

### Identity and curation provenance

Identity/name relationships retain source fields such as `source_contact_id`, `source_document_id`, `source_merge_entity_id`, `source_curator`, `extractor`, `resolution_policy`, `reason` and timestamps. Manual Findings decisions retain `curator_actor`, decision status/reason/timestamps and the supporting Finding/Document relationships.

## Relationship types and properties

Relationship properties are optional. Endpoint keys and labels provide identity; relationship metadata provides provenance and workflow state.

| Relationship | Direction / purpose | Optional properties used |

- OrganizationalUnit: `org_unit_display_name` on `display_name`
- ContactRecord: `contact_uid` on `vcard_uid`; `contact_cloud` on `cloud_id`; `contact_source_user` on `source_user_id`; `contact_addressbook_name` on `addressbook_name`; `contact_addressbook_slug` on `addressbook_slug`; `contact_created_import_run` on `created_import_run_id`; `contact_last_import_run` on `last_import_run_id`

## Query assumptions and warning policy

Queries may assume that constrained identifiers are present on matching nodes. They must not assume that any optional field or relationship type exists anywhere in the database. Neo4j emits an `UnknownPropertyKeyWarning` when a query directly names a property token that has never existed, and an `UnknownRelationshipTypeWarning` when a read query statically names a relationship type that has never been created.

RC4 attempted to avoid property warnings by writing optional names onto `RAGSchemaMarker` nodes. That was incomplete, drifted from the real application schema and polluted the graph. 0.8.5-rc4.1 instead:

1. reads optional node and relationship fields through `properties(value)['field']`;
2. reads optional/sparse relationship types through a generic relationship variable plus `type(r)='RELATIONSHIP_TYPE'` where absence is a valid state;
3. keeps relationship creation statements explicit (for example `MERGE ...[:MERGED_INTO]...`) so write-path spelling/schema errors remain visible;
4. creates only real constraints and indexes;
5. backfills only real application data where semantics are deterministic;
6. retains missing optional fields and absent optional relationship types as missing.

The recurring `RelationObservation.relation_text` property warning and sparse-graph relationship warnings such as `MENTIONS_NAME` or `MERGED_INTO` are instances of the same general rule: absence is valid and must not require synthetic graph data merely to register a token.

## Initialization and upgrades

`GraphStore.ensure_schema()` is the canonical entry point. It:

1. creates missing base constraints/indexes;
2. lazily backfills historic global Entity form decisions using `ON CREATE SET`;
3. fills missing `Entity.entity_kind` only, without reclassifying existing values;
4. creates the Research Finding/Run/User schema;
5. backfills a missing Finding `curation_hash` without changing Finding IDs.

The standard installer waits for selected local Neo4j and runs:

```bash
python -m rag.graph --config /opt/nextcloud-rag/config.yaml init
```

The Super-Light installer runs the same command inside the API image. API startup also attempts the idempotent migration for independently managed deployments; failure is logged and deferred because Neo4j remains a degradable backend. Installer-selected local Neo4j failure is fatal.

## Legacy and migration notes

- Historic nodes may omit any optional property.
- Existing `RAGSchemaMarker` nodes are inert compatibility debris. 0.8.5-rc4.1 does not create, query or depend on them.
- Legacy Entity observations are promoted to `EntityFormDecision` only when no newer global decision exists.
- Legacy Findings receive `curation_hash` only when the stored query frame is parseable.
- Existing constraints or indexes, including equivalent objects already present under another name, are accepted by Neo4j's `IF NOT EXISTS` semantics.
- No migration deletes Entities, Documents, observations, claims, identity forms or provenance relationships.

## Verification

The normal CI uses contract tests because it does not run a Neo4j service. The tests cover fresh, partial, already initialized and repeated initialization; required constraints/indexes; non-overwriting legacy backfills; property-safe warning regressions; and installer invocation. A deployment-level acceptance test should additionally run `python -m rag.graph ... init` twice against a Neo4j 5 Community database and inspect server notifications/logs.
