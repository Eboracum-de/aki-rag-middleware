# SunaQ Recherche 0.3.4

Schlankes Nextcloud-23+-Frontend für SunaQ / Eboracum Research Gateway 0.8.6.

## Current behaviour

- server-side proxy with the current Nextcloud UID (`X-RAG-User-ID`); the provider key never reaches browser JavaScript;
- authenticated model discovery through `/v1/models`; the selector exposes only profiles allowed for the current user;
- compact chat composer with model selection, source chips and Enter-to-send;
- collapsible per-user research sidebar;
- safe framework-free Markdown subset (no raw HTML);
- request progress polling through the identity-scoped SunaQ status endpoint;
- verifier progress can report the current document batch, for example
  `Prüfe Dokumente 11–15 von 48 …`;
- per user question: **Erneut senden** and **Bearbeiten & erneut senden**;
- provider follow-up actions are rendered as compact buttons below the current
  answer, for example **Mit Tief erneut suchen** or **Anfrage präzisieren**;
- a stronger-model suggestion is shown only when a strictly stronger profile is
  currently allowed for that user;
- visible context-boundary hint: unrelated topics should use a new chat;
- effective source scopes are shown next to each SunaQ answer;
- source chips are filtered by authenticated server capabilities. Optional
  sources that are globally disabled or not enabled for the current user are not
  shown in the UI and are also rejected server-side when requested explicitly;
- persistent per-user chat history as Markdown plus metadata when both the global
  and per-user chat archive capability are enabled below one
  administrator-selected Nextcloud path (default: `SunaQ-Chats/`);
- legacy `.akirag.json` / Legacy-HTML records remain readable when they are
  inside the selected archive path. SunaQ does not scan `SunaQ-Chats/` and `AKI-Chats/`
  in parallel. For an older RC archive, either configure that user's target as
  `AKI-Chats` or move the files once to the selected SunaQ path.

The model list is loaded when the app starts. If an administrator changes a
user's model entitlement while an existing browser tab remains open, reload the
app to refresh the selector.

Follow-up suggestions are deliberately transient UI actions. They are returned
with the live provider response but are not persisted in the archived chat,
because a later session may have different model entitlements or retrieval
state.

## Source selection

The provider's client-neutral implicit default is **Documents only**.

The SunaQ app intentionally starts with **Documents only** selected. Other
OpenAI-compatible clients that send no source directive use the same provider
default. Mail/Web/chat scopes remain explicit choices, and administrator
capability gates remain authoritative.

Explicit directives in the user request override the UI selection:

- `/documents`
- `/mailarchive`
- `/webarchive`
- `/chatarchive`
- `/web`

## Chat branching

When a user edits an earlier question, the conversation is branched at that
question. The old question and its later answers are not sent together with the
edited question.

## Installation

Copy the `sunaq` app directory into the Nextcloud `apps/` tree and enable it:

```bash
sudo -u <web-user> php occ app:enable sunaq
```

Configure **SunaQ URL** and **Provider API key** under **Settings →
Administration → Additional settings**. The app registers a normal Nextcloud
navigation entry and ships its own `img/app.svg`.

For an intentionally internal SunaQ URL, Nextcloud may require
`allow_local_remote_servers => true`. The Nextcloud host must trust the TLS CA
used by the middleware endpoint. Credential-bearing requests require HTTPS by
default. Plain HTTP is available only through the explicit **Unsicheres HTTP**
administrator opt-in for controlled lab/test networks. Users still complete the middleware's one-time
Nextcloud Login Flow; the resulting app credential is reusable for live ACL and
optional Kontakt-DB synchronization.

- 0.3.0: SunaQ app id/name, model selector, request progress, source chips and
  provider follow-up actions.
- 0.3.1: per-user single chat-archive path and HTTPS-by-default provider
  credential transport with an explicit lab-only HTTP opt-in.
- 0.3.2: server-controlled chat persistence plus lifecycle cleanup for manually

  authenticated capability check confirms that the source is available.
